# SimDemify
This extension converts certain text in your browser to more SimDemocracy-oriented text.

ROADMAP:
- Allow exclusion of some webpages
- Add in-browser UI to control the extension
- Allow user to add custom strings to change
- Add option to super-simdemify (redirect wikipedia to qwrky.dev, etc.)
